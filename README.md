**PROGRAM 6A:**

**Aim: To Print Even Values between 0 and 10.** 

**Tool: VS CODE.**

**Theory:**
This program illustrates basic control structures in C++:
- for loop
- if conditional
- modulus operator (%)
- cout for output

Core Concepts Involved:
- Looping: The for loop runs from i = 0 to i = 10.
- Even Number Check: Inside the loop, the condition i % 2 == 0 checks if i is divisible by 2 (i.e., even).
- Output Statement: If the condition is true, it prints the value of i using cout.

 How it works:
- The loop begins at i = 0.
- For each value of i up to 10, it checks if i is even.
- If i is even, it’s printed. If not, it’s skipped.
- The result is a display of all even numbers from 0 to 10.

Integration of Concepts:
The code shows how:
- Iteration (for loop) walks through each number.
- Selection (if statement) filters only even numbers.
- Output (cout) shows the result.
This reflects a classic algorithmic pattern: traverse a set → apply a condition → perform an action based on that condition.

Summary of Behavior:
- The program starts with i = 0.
- It increments i one by one up to 10.
- During each step, it checks whether i is even.
- If yes, it prints the number.

Real-World Applications:
This logic may be basic, but it’s everywhere:
- Filtering even rows/IDs in databases
- Selecting alternate frames in video processing
- Applying rules to numbers in signal processing (like sampling)
- Triggering events based on pattern recognition in embedded systems.

**Conclusion:**
This simple program demonstrates conditional iteration and the use of the modulus operator for filtering numeric patterns (in this case, even numbers). It’s an essential foundation for learning how to apply logic to control the flow of execution in a program. This concept can be expanded to filter odd numbers, prime numbers, or custom sequences.
